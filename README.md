1. About our website: Our online resale mobile store is a great place to buy and sell gently used phones, tablets, computers and accessories. We offer a wide variety of devices from top name brands, and our prices are unbeatable. Whether you're looking for a new phone or tablet, or you're looking to upgrade your current device, our online store is the perfect place to start.

2. Here, three types of users are dealt with, customer, seller and admin. In this, the customer can book the product. Can delete the booked product and if desired, purchase the product. If the payment is complete, the product that made the payment will show paid. And if he wants, after paying, he can delete it and it will be deleted from the payment. And at the time of booking, if there is a problem with any product, then admin can report it.

3. Let's discuss the accesses of a seller in the second. Seller can add any category, if not on the website. You can add products by category. The products that were added, if someone makes a booking, can see the details of that customer. And anyone who has added products, can do advertising if they want to sell any of these products quickly. But if not sold then available status will show and if advertised then advertising will show. But if it is sold, then instead of showing available, it will show sold and can't advertise status. And if the seller wants, he can delete any product.

4. And some features have also been added with the role of admin as the last user. You can see all the customers and sellers on the admin dashboard and you can make anyone an admin if you want. A seller can make a verified sale and if a customer reports, on the item. In that case, you can see all the details of the reported item and if you want, you can contact us by email.

5. Here some animations are used, lottie is used for that. Also, some more functions and libraries, frameworks are used. For example, Stripe is used for payment. As Api, React Query, React Axios are used. For routing, React router is used. With new Date(), the time is taken along with the date. Functions are also used, along with some more important attributes.

6. And here on the home page, I used React Slick. On each page visit, dynamic title is given. JWT token is used and user is verified, besides giving access to all places, all activities are done. And used Theme, for Day/Dark mood. In this case, I used daisyui of css tailwind.
